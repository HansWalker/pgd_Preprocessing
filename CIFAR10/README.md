The folder contains the code needed to train the cifar10 autoencoders, train the cifar10 classifiers, and evaluate them. The train-x-c code trains the individual autoencoders. There are 12 in total. There is a flag retrain which determines if the code will restart training of a model or not. The train-cifar10-adv code trains an adversarial classifier. train-pgd-deep-n trains a classifier just on the raw cifar10 images. The eval scripts evaluate the different classifiers. Note this code runs on TensorFlow 2.0+
